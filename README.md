## Basic Details
### Team Name: Codeplay


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gouri B - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology
- Member 2: Rena Sayam K - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology

### Project Description
A humorous and interactive web app where a user clicks on a digital fortune cookie that cracks open with an animation and delivers a sarcastic or brutally honest fortune. Because what you really need isn't motivation ‚Äî it's roasted reality.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too pampered with sweet, positive fortune cookies and life-affirming messages. There's an urgent need to bring them back to Earth ‚Äî fast.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A fortune cookie that cracks open not to bless your day ‚Äî but to roast you. A roulette of fortune and sarcasm ‚Äî it‚Äôs unpredictable, hilarious, and borderline disrespectful.
